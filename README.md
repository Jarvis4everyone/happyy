- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Deepgram STT for accurate speech-to-text transcription
- **Natural Voice Synthesis**: TTS support via Deepgram or Cartesia for natural-sounding speech
- **Web Dashboard**: Beautiful, responsive web interface for call management
- **Live Logs**: Real-time call logs and conversation monitoring
- **Pre-optimized Audio**: Pre-generated welcome message for instant call initiation
- **Smart Voice Detection**: Advanced silence detection to wait for complete user sentences
- **Call Management**: Start, stop, and monitor calls through the web interface

## üìñ Usage

### Making a Call via Web Dashboard

1. Log in to the web dashboard
2. Enter a 10-digit Indian phone number (without +91)
3. Click "Make Call" button
4. Watch live logs as the AI conversation progresses
5. Use "Stop Call" to end an active call
6. Use "New Call" to make another call

### Making a Call via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "+919876543210"}'
```

### Stopping a Call

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/call/{callSid}
```

## üîß Configuration

### TTS Provider Options

**Deepgram (Default)**
- Set `VOICE_MODEL` in `.env` (e.g., `aura-asteria-en`)
- Uses Deepgram TTS API

**Cartesia**
- Set `TTS_PROVIDER=cartesia` in `.env`
- Requires `CARTESIA_API_KEY` and `CARTESIA_VOICE_ID`
- Better quality for Hindi language

### Voice Detection Settings

The system is optimized to wait for complete user sentences before processing:

- `endpointing: 1000ms` - Delay before considering speech final
- `utterance_end_ms: 2000ms` - Wait time for utterance end
- Additional 1.5s delay after speech_final for complete sentences

These settings can be adjusted in `services/transcription-service.js`.

## üéØ Key Features Explained

### Pre-generated Welcome Message
The welcome message audio is generated at server startup for instant playback when calls connect, eliminating initial delay.

### Smart Silence Detection
Advanced logic ensures the AI waits for users to finish speaking completely before responding, preventing interruptions and partial transcriptions.

### Live Log Streaming
All call events, transcriptions, and AI responses are streamed in real-time to the web dashboard via WebSocket connections.

### Responsive Web Interface
The dashboard is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## üîê Security Notes

- Change the default login credentials in `public/app.js`
- Use environment variables for all sensitive keys
- Ensure your server uses HTTPS in production
- Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control

## üìù API Endpoints

### Web Dashboard
- `GET /` - Dashboard home page

### Call Management
- `POST /api/call` - Initiate an outbound call
- `DELETE /api/call/:callSid` - Terminate a call
- `GET /api/calls` - List active calls

### WebSocket
- `WS /logs` - Real-time log streaming

### Twilio Integration
- `POST /incoming` - Twilio webhook for incoming streams
- `WS /connection` - Twilio media stream WebSocket

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Calls not connecting
- Verify your `SERVER` URL is publicly accessible
- Check Twilio webhook configuration
- Ensure ngrok tunnel is active (if using ngrok)

### No audio in calls
- Verify TTS API keys are correct
- Check Deepgram/Cartesia API status
- Review console logs for TTS errors

### Transcription issues
- Verify Deepgram API key
- Check network connectivity
- Review Deepgram connection logs

### Web dashboard not loading
- Ensure `public` directory exists
- Check server is running on correct port
- Verify static file serving is enabled

## üöÄ Deployment to Render

This application is ready to deploy on Render. See [RENDER_DEPLOY.md](./RENDER_DEPLOY.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

### Quick Render Deployment Steps:

1. **Push code to GitHub**
2. **Create a new Web Service on Render**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Choose "Docker" as the runtime
   - Set health check path: `/incoming`
3. **Set Environment Variables** in Render dashboard:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3000
   SERVER=your-service-name.onrender.com
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
   FROM_NUMBER=+1234567890
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   VOICE_MODEL=aura-asteria-en
   ```
4. **After first deploy**, update `SERVER` with your actual Render URL (without https://)
5. **Update Twilio webhook** to: `https://your-service-name.onrender.com/incoming`

> **Note**: Render free tier services spin down after inactivity. Upgrade to paid plan for production use.
